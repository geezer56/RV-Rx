        <div class="container">
            <p>Too many times the first story I hear from a RVer is a sad tale about the 1st unit they owned. Their pleasant dreams of travelling the country dashed by an unscrupulous dealer or private seller who was only too happy to see their nightmare of a coach or trailer disappear around the corner. Just about the time the seller was cashing the check, the buyer was discovering that the "pristine" RV they just spent their hard earned dollars for was not all that the seller had made it out to be. The dream had turned into a reality of ruined vacations and thousands of dollars wasted.
            </p>
