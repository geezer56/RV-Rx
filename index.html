    <h2>Our Mission</h2></div>
   <div class="container"> <p>Too many times the first story I hear from a RVer is a sad tale about the 1st unit they owned.  Their pleasant dreams of travelling the country dashed by an unscrupulous dealer or private seller who was only too happy to see their nightmare of a coach or trailer disappear around the corner.  Just about the time the seller was cashing the check, the buyer was discovering that the "pristine" RV they just spent their hard earned dollars for was not all that the seller had made it out to be.  The dream had turned into a reality of ruined vacations and thousands of dollars wasted. 
       </p>
       <p>At RV Rx we are committed to making sure that when you start telling <strong>YOUR</strong> RV stories, that 1st cautionary tale is not included. By providing a complete set of RV services, including the most comprehensive inspection in the industry, we can provide you with the information and systems know-how that you will need to beginn your RV journey with confidence.  Our inspection X-Ray will ensure that you know everything you need to negotiate the best price or even walk away from a potential disaster. </p>

          <p>Your smart RV purchase starts with smart planning.  RV Rx can help you establish the criteria that you will use to evaluate the myraid options that are available.  New or Used? What style? Floor plan? Size? Hidden costs? Maybe you think you would like a towable. Should you consider renting first?(Answer: YES!)  </p>

            <h1 class="center">Inspection</h1>
              <p>All inspections are performed by a <a href="https://nrvia.org/" target="_blank"> NRVIA </a> level 2 certified inspector.  An inspection is not just a good idea for the purchaser.  Private sellers, insurance companies, banks and warranty companies all have varying degrees of interest in understanding the condition of the unit that is being considered.  The inspection results however are the sole property of our client and will not be shared with anyone else without explicit permission of our client.    </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-4">
              <h1 class="center">Walk-through</h1>
              <p> You are the proud owner of a brand new or new to you RV! If this is your 1st RV the dealer or the seller might have given you a brief overview of the systems and a stack of manuals to read, handed you the keys and wished you luck.  It's not luck you will need, but a real systems orientation and maintenance preview.  We will guide you through a hands on demonstration of all the on board systems, roof to basement, bumper to bumper, batteries to bilge!  </p>
